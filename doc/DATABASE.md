## Schema Overview

The database consists of 5 core tables, 1 audit log, and 6 reference tables:

```text
organization (1) ──< (N) employee
                 └──< (N) payroll_period
                 └──< (N) employee_compensation_package

employee_compensation_package (1) ──< (N) employee
                                   └──< (N) payroll_result

payroll_period (1) ──< (N) payroll_result (N) >── employee
```

Reference tables (`gender`, `marital_status`, `legal_form`, `currency`,
`payroll_period_status`, `audit_action`) are seeded once in the migration
and act as FK targets for enum columns across the core tables.

**Key Principles:**

- Multi-tenant from the start (organization-scoped)
- Soft deletes on all main tables (`deleted_at`)
- Money stored as integer cents
- Historical accuracy — calculated fields stored, not recomputed
- Audit trail for compliance

## Tables

### `organization`

Represents a company in the system. Root of the multi-tenant hierarchy.

| Column       | Type | Constraints     | Description                       |
| ------------ | ---- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `id`         | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY     | UUID                              |
| `name`       | TEXT | NOT NULL        | Organization name                 |
| `address`    | TEXT |                 | Physical address                  |
| `activity`   | TEXT |                 | Business activity description     |
| `legal_form` | TEXT | FK → legal_form | Legal structure                   |
| `ice_num`    | TEXT | UNIQUE          | ICE number (Moroccan business ID) |
| `if_num`     | TEXT | UNIQUE          | IF number (tax ID)                |
| `rc_num`     | TEXT | UNIQUE          | RC number (commerce registry)     |
| `cnss_num`   | TEXT | UNIQUE          | CNSS registration number          |
| `bank_rib`   | TEXT | UNIQUE          | Bank account RIB                  |
| `created_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL        | ISO 8601 timestamp                |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL        | ISO 8601 timestamp                |
| `deleted_at` | TEXT |                 | Soft delete timestamp             |

---

### `employee_compensation_package`

Immutable compensation records. Treated as historical artifacts once referenced
by a payroll result — cannot be deleted while in use (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`).

A separate table (rather than inline fields on `employee`) allows tracking
compensation changes over time and preserves the exact package used for each
payroll calculation.

| Column              | Type    | Constraints                 | Description                   |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `id`                | TEXT    | PRIMARY KEY                 | UUID                          |
| `org_id`            | TEXT    | FK → organization, NOT NULL | Owning organization           |
| `name`              | TEXT    | NOT NULL                    | Human-readable package name   |
| `base_salary_cents` | INTEGER | NOT NULL, >= 0              | Monthly salary in cents (MAD) |
| `currency`          | TEXT    | NOT NULL, FK → currency     | Currency code                 |
| `created_at`        | TEXT    | NOT NULL                    | ISO 8601 timestamp            |
| `updated_at`        | TEXT    | NOT NULL                    | ISO 8601 timestamp            |
| `deleted_at`        | TEXT    |                             | Soft delete timestamp         |

**Index:** `idx_comp_package_org_id` on `(org_id)` for efficient org-scoped lookups.

**Constraints:**

- `UNIQUE(org_id, serial_num)` — employee numbers are unique per organization
- `gender` only has MALE/FEMALE because Moroccan official documents don't recognize other options
- Serial numbers are generated by the application (not database auto-increment) to support per-org numbering

### Reference Tables

Six read-only tables act as FK targets for enum columns. Each has a single
`code TEXT PRIMARY KEY` column and is seeded in the migration. No application
query reads from them — enforcement is purely at the database level.

| Table                   | Valid codes                                   | Used by                                                             |

Adding a new valid value requires a migration that inserts a new row — no schema edit needed.

## Relationships

- **Organization is the root.** One org has many employees and many payroll periods. Deleting an org cascades to both.
- **Compensation packages are shared.** One package can be used by multiple employees and referenced by multiple payroll results. They cannot be deleted while referenced (`RESTRICT`).
- **Payroll structure:**

```text
Organization
    ↓ (1:N)
PayrollPeriod (e.g., December 2025)
    ↓ (1:N)
PayrollResult (one per employee)
    ├→ Employee (who)
    └→ CompensationPackage (what compensation was used)
```

## Foreign Key Strategies

### CASCADE — delete children when parent is deleted

Used when child records are meaningless without the parent.

| Child Table      | Parent Table     | Rationale                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `employee`       | `organization`   | Employees belong to an org                     |
| `payroll_period` | `organization`   | Periods belong to an org                       |
| `payroll_result` | `payroll_period` | Results are part of a period; delete together  |
| `payroll_result` | `employee`       | If employee is deleted, their payroll goes too |

Note: soft deletes mean CASCADE rarely triggers in practice. Hard deletes are for data purging only.

### RESTRICT — cannot delete if children exist

Used when the parent is a historical artifact that must be preserved.

| Child Table      | Parent Table           | Rationale                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `employee`       | `compensation_package` | Can't delete a package if employees are using it              |
| `payroll_result` | `compensation_package` | Historical record — must preserve the exact compensation used |

Once a compensation package is referenced by a payroll result, it is a permanent artifact.

## Indexes

| Index Name                           | Table            | Columns                 | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `idx_employee_org_id`                | `employee`       | `org_id`                | Find employees by organization        |
| `idx_payroll_period_org_id`          | `payroll_period` | `org_id`                | Find periods by organization          |
| `idx_payroll_result_period_id`       | `payroll_result` | `payroll_period_id`     | Find results for a period             |
| `idx_payroll_result_employee_id`     | `payroll_result` | `employee_id`           | Find payroll history for employee     |
| `idx_audit_log_table_name_record_id` | `audit_log`      | `table_name, record_id` | Query audit trail for specific record |
| `idx_audit_log_timestamp`            | `audit_log`      | `timestamp DESC`        | Query recent changes                  |

SQLite automatically indexes PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE columns.

## Data Types & Conventions

### UUIDs

Stored as TEXT in RFC 4122 format (`550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`).
Generated in application code using `google/uuid`. Never generated by the database.

### Timestamps

Stored as TEXT in ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 format (`2025-01-09T10:30:45Z`).
Always generated and stored in UTC. Human-readable and compatible with SQLite date functions.

### Money

Stored as INTEGER in cents (Moroccan Dirhams × 100). Example: 10,234.56 MAD → `1023456`.
Avoids floating-point precision errors. Use the `pkg/money` type in application code.

### Enums

Stored as TEXT, enforced via foreign keys to reference tables (SQLite has no native ENUM type).
Example: `gender TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES gender(code)`, where the `gender` table
is seeded with all valid codes. Adding a new value is a single-row INSERT migration.

### Soft Deletes

`deleted_at` column (TEXT, nullable). Active records have `deleted_at IS NULL`.
All standard queries filter on this. Use `IncludingDeleted` query variants when access
to archived records is needed.

## Query Organization

All database interactions use sqlc-generated code from SQL files in `db/query/`.

```text
db/query/
├── organization.sql
├── employee.sql
├── employee_compensation_package.sql
├── payroll_period.sql
├── payroll_result.sql
└── audit_log.sql
```

**Naming conventions:**

- `Get{Entity}` / `Get{Entity}By{Criteria}` — single record
- `List{Entities}` / `List{Entities}By{Criteria}` — multiple records
- `Get{Entity}IncludingDeleted` / `List{Entities}IncludingDeleted` — includes soft-deleted
- `Create{Entity}` — insert, returns created record (`:one` with `RETURNING *`)
- `Update{Entity}` — generic update, returns updated record
- `Delete{Entity}` / `Restore{Entity}` / `HardDelete{Entity}` — soft delete, restore, permanent delete
- `{Verb}{Entity}` — explicit workflow operations (e.g., `FinalizePayrollPeriod`)
- `Count{Entities}...` — aggregate queries for usage guards
